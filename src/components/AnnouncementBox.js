          We love the first whiff of sizzling sardines, the caf√© buzz on every
          corner, and that moment when the Atlas mountains peek through the
          clouds. ‚ù§Ô∏è

          But there are also those times: the four-hour wait for a five-minute
          task, the paperwork that needs a copy of a copy of a stamp, and the
          taxi that claims the meter is "on vacation." We have laughed,
          face-palmed, and heard the classic line, "Relax, it‚Äôs part of the
          adventure."

        <p>
          That is why we built this spot: a comfy, anonymous place to swap the
          good, the bad, and the ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt believe this‚Äù moments of life in
          Morocco. Stack them all together and we might see what works, what
          does not, and what needs a gentle nudge.

          But there are also those times: the four-hour wait for a five-minute
          task, the paperwork that needs a copy of a copy of a stamp, and the
          taxi that claims the meter is &ldquo;on vacation.&rdquo;

          This board is a way to collect our stories to show there‚Äôs a distinct
          pattern of bad service interactions in this country, which is unlike
          the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully by collecting these stories, Morocco can use them as
          feedback and improve for both foreigners and locals.
